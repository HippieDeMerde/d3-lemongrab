# d3-bullet-chart

The bullet chart is completely inspired from http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4061961. But I did it my way and without looking at the code, so I'm proud enough to publish it !

## Controls
You have three buttons :
- Generate new random datas
- Add a new bullet entry
- Remove a bullet entry

The graph adapts to the number of bullet entries, and to the random datas newly generated.
